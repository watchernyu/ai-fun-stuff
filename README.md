# ai-fun-stuff
A list of references to fun stuff to read or watch or interact with, related to AI (maybe mainly ml). Mainly for students who are taking their first ML class and want to find out more about the many possibilities of ml. 

Stuff here don't have to be useful... but should be fun. :D

For students who are currently taking Machine Learning at NYU Shanghai (Spring 2019), feel free to post an issue if there is a ML direction you would like to work for your project, I can try search for interesting articles for you and add to the list here.
